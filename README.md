# Emotions Detector

Emotions Detector is a project that predicts emotions from images.
Users can input an image from their computer and the app will analyze it.
This project is done for me to learn how to gather image data, how to clean and process images, learn the basics of machine learning algorithms.

## Skills
- Use Python as main coding language
- Use pandas and matplotlib to analyze data
- Learn how to gather datasets
- Learn how to clean data and check if data is valid
- Use OpenCV to process images
- Use sklearn for machine learning algorithms
